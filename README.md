# MNIST-Tensorflow
MNIST dataset trained using CNN in tensorflow 

The dataset of this project has been downloaded from keras dataset. Then it is trained using convolutional neural network in tensorflow. 

Required libraries can be found in requirements.txt file.
This project includes :

**1. Image Pre-processing**  Image augmentation has been applied to the images to increase the size of dataset and increase the overall accuracy of model in real life scenarios. Code implementing this can be found in Image Pre-Processing.ipynb where images are rotated 30Â° in both directions.

**2. Training**  Using the dataset gerenated after image preprocessing, CNN model is trained and accuracy above 99% is achieved. Its implementation can be found in training.ipynb file. 

**3. Flask web application** :
